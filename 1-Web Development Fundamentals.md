### Summary

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to define the structure and contents of web pages.
- CSS (Cascading Stylesheets) are used for styling web pages.
- JavaScript is a programming language used for making web pages interactive.
- To view a web page, we enter its URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the browser’s address bar.
- To view the HTML behind a web page, we right-click on the page and select View Source or View Page Source.
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a set of rules that clients and servers use to communicate and exchange data.
- When you visit a website, your browser (client) sends an HTTP request to the server and receives an HTTP response. The response includes an HTML document that represents the page you’re visiting. The browser reads the HTML document to construct a Document Object Model (an in-memory representation of the elements on the page). Once the DOM is ready, the browser renders (displays) the target page.
- We can use the Network tab of Chrome DevTools to inspect HTTP requests and responses exchanged between the browser and the server.
- An HTML document consists of a DOCTYPE declaration that specifies the version of HTML being used followed by a tree (hierarchy) of elements that define the structure and content of the document.
- The root element in an HTML document is the html element which always includes a head and a body element. The head element contains information about the page such as its title. The body element includes the structure and content of the page.
- Most HTML elements include an opening and closing tag.
- We can use attributes to provide additional information about an element (like the source of an image). Attributes are coded as part of the opening tag.
- To style an element using CSS, we write a CSS rule which consists of a selector and one or more declarations.
- The selector is used to target one or more elements. We can select elements by their type, class, ID and so on.
- A declaration consists of a property, a colon, a value and is terminated by a semicolon.
- Using validation services we can ensure that our HTML/CSS code is valid and follows the official rules. This helps us get better rankings in search engines.
